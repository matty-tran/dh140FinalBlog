            "content": "G.G. Good Game? by Matthew Tran . March 14, 2022 . Introduction . In the modern age, video games have become a modern past time enjoyed by many people of various ages. A now lucrative industry, video games come in a variety of genres, experiences, and platforms. When asked about successful video games, a handful of titles might come to mind. Ones that are iconic because of their characters, revolutionary because of the way they engage with storytelling, or perhaps nostalgic because of how long they have been around. . This project seeks to define top performing video games and the traits that may have contributed to the success of these titles. Subsequently, I would like to conduct a more qualitative investigation on these titles, mainly examining reviews to paint a clearer picture of what consumers like about top games. . The Data . Initial exploration of defining what makes a good game will be conducted using the Video Games CORGIS dataset which can be accessed here. This data was originally collected by Dr. Joe Cox who conducted an empirical investigation of U.S. sales data of video games. Dr. Cox concluded that the major factors that predict for a title&#39;s ability to attain &quot;blockbuster&quot; status were threefold: the company that produced the title, the console, and the critic reviews. . I would like to use the data that Dr. Cox collected, which spans thousands of titles that were released between 2004 and 2010, and conduct my own analysis agnostic to his fidnings. . The categoies that I am interested in and their possible effects on the success of a game are: . Maximum number of players: how many people can play this game at one time? | Online Features: does the game support online play? | Genre: what genre does this game belong to? | Within these categories, I would like to measure success of a game using: . Review score: the typical review score out of 100 | Sales: the total sales made on the game measured in millions of dollars | Completionist: players reported completing everything in the game | Data Exploration .

Takeaways from initial data exploration: . Because of the saturation of Action games, I would like to take a closer look at the metrics for success in that specific genre, as well as the other genres that are well-represented in the market. | Because the games that were successful in these categories were all sequels of some kind, I think it would be interested to investigate if there are any titles that were successful without being a sequel, which would speak to the degree to which a factor like nostalgia or investment in a story/ universe contribute to a title&#39;s success. | Because these three games did not have a max player capacity above 2, are there any titles that support multiplayer that are also finding success? | Are there certain publishers or consoles that are finding more general success with their titles than others? | Further Exploration . Based on the preliminary findings from my first data exploration, I would like to take a closer look at the data in certain places. . Defining Success . Using the metrics I established previously, I would like to examine the top-performing games in the categories of critic reviews, sales, and number of completionists. . 1. Critic Reviews . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;&gt; . Here, a sucessful game by critic review was defined as having a critic review score of over 90, of which there were 29 games. It does not seem to be the case, however, that a high critic score correlates very strongly to commercial success in sales. In fact, the games that received the highest critic scores were not the ones which had the most number of sales, with a handfull of games receiving more commercial sucess, and the highest seller (in this group) having the lowest critics score... . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;&gt; . I observed an even weaker relationship between critic review scores and number of completionists in for the games. . This could however be because the games which received the highest critic review scores, such as Grand Theft Auto IV, are known for being &quot;open-world&quot; games in which the player can freely navigate the world without the story being a main part of interacting with the game. . df2[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, &#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, &#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;, &#39;Metadata.Genres&#39;]].sort_values(&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ascending = False) .

Notably, 27 out of the 29 titles that were considered top-performers as described by their critic review scores had Action as one of their genre descriptors. The two games that did not belong to this genre were considered as Role-Playing and Racing/ Driving games. . 2. Commercial Sales . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;&gt; . Very interestingly, for the top-performing games in terms if sales, being 14 games, there was actually a negative correlation between sales and critic scores. Shockingly, the game with the most sales had the lowest (sub-60) score of the group of games! However, the games with the highest critic scores in this set still had sales that were above the mean of the entire set, so these games were by no means unsuccessful. . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;&gt; . A similar negative relationship was observed between sales and number of completionist players. For similar reasons as the to critic scores grouping, the top game, Wii Play, is not a game that is well-known for having a definitive plot that players follow, but rather is a game that is often played socially with family and friends. .

The distribution of genres in this group were slightly more diverse than that of the critic scores group. While Action games still held a slight majority at 8 out 14 games being part of the Action genre, Role-Playing, sports, and Driving games made up the remainder of this group. . 3. Completionists (or not?) . Following my analysis of the top-performing games under critic scores and commercial sales, I have decided not to continue with using number of completionists as a measure of success for a variety of reasons. Firstly, this number would already be skewed because of how the number of players would affect this figure, and completionist data as such would require standardization. While the additional work of standardizing this data is not very much work, I also chose not to use number of completionists in the remainder of my analysis because of how easily this number could be affected by the type of game. There are many games that are made simply to be enjoyed, and do not have the aspect of following a story or plot that other games have. In the former case, players would not be as motivated to &quot;complete&quot; the game, which would skew how the number of com . Action Games and Reviews? . Because of the overrepresentation of Action games in the games with high critic reviews, I wanted to explore the idea that critics tend to favor games that are of the Action genre. . df_action[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 0 85 4 61 13 74 17 74 18 72 .. 1197 42 1200 30 1204 58 1205 70 1211 39 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 476, dtype: int64&gt; . . df_sports[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 3 81 8 68 40 75 47 74 51 83 .. 1143 63 1163 63 1167 65 1170 80 1199 68 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 166, dtype: int64&gt; . . df_strategy[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 1 89 7 75 15 73 48 83 70 90 .. 1159 71 1177 78 1190 63 1198 74 1202 56 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 62, dtype: int64&gt; . . Looking at the 3 most common genres and examining the mean critic review scores, it seems that there does not seem to be an inherent bias for Action games amonst critics, since strategy games had a higher mean score, though I think this is one area of analysis that could benefit from more investigation. . Who&#39;s at the Top? . From both my own personal perspective, as well as how I assume businesses and consumers would define success, I think commerical sales is the best way to mesure the success of a game. However, because I think critic reviews may encapsulate some measure of the quality of a game, I think it would be beneficial to include critics reviews as a measure of success in some way. Therefore, I decided that when choosing the &quot;top games,&quot; I would choose those games that were present in both categories or top-performers in critic scores and sales. That is, games that received both above a 90 on critic scores and had sales above 4.69. . To account for any phenomenon that goes beyond any conventional measure of success I would like to include those titles that had extremely high sales, but perhaps were not deemed a &quot;good game&quot; by critics. These three games would be: Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and New Super Mario Bros, all titles that had commericial sales greater that 10 million dollars. . top_sales .

Discussion . Examining the commonalities among the top performing games, it is clear that Nintendo games have the highest sales. They make up 6 of the 9 games that I identified as top-performing games, and represent the 6 highest-earning games in the entire dataset. This seems to operate independently of critic reviews, as the three highest selling games did not receive scores above 90 from critics. . I think that there are factors, especially metadata about each game beyond the scope of information that was included in this dataset, that contributes to why games from Nintendo, and especially those that came out at the top of this dataset were considered top-performers by sales. . Three of the top four games- Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and Mario Kart DS- are titles that do not have a strong storyline for the player to follow. Rather, they are multiplayer games that are centered around gaming as a social aspect. With family or friends, players can compete on teams with or against each other. Because you are constantly playing with real people in a competitive environment, the gaming experience is kept dynamic and engaging, rather then relying on a progressing in a story line. . When considering what kinds of games are successful in the market, it may be helpful to consider whether a game is player-versus-player (PVP) or player-vs-everyone (PVE). Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and Mario Kart DS, are examples of PVP games, that is, players do not play by the themselves against computers, but rather against other real players, and these kinds of games inherently carry with them a competitive aspect. In terms of motivation, players are motivated to constantly return to the game in order to hone their skills in the game. In many PVE games, players are instead motivated by the desire to progress in the game itself. . The other game that was represented in the top-performing game, despite not having the same PVP quality as the others, was New Super Mario Bros. I think the reason that this title in particular was so successful is because of its recognisability. Just the name Mario in the gaming sphere is already enough for people, gamer or not, to have a mental image of what the game will entail. As a game that has had many remakes and interations, I think that this game&#39;s successful largely comes from its capacity to combine the nostalgia of players with the refreshing nature of a game remake or sequel. A game beloved by many, the Super Mario series of games is one that people are invested in because of their emotional attatchment to the games and characters. . When it comes to learning, motivation is a crucial part of pedagogy. In both the conventional sense and in the realm of possibly gamifying learning, I think that it would be helpful to incoroporate a healthy amount of competition, whether it be against the self or against others. I think it is also important for students to have the ability to engage with other students as well, as this social aspect to learning and gaming is something that motivates students additionally. . Nintendo: A Closer Look . Looking at the top-performing games, it is clear to see that Nintendo has a clear group on the gaming market when it comes to sales. As such, I would like to examine just what about these games makes them so desirable to players, and as such I would like to look to Nintendo themselves to see how they would market and describe these games. . It&#39;s Mario&#39;s World and We&#39;re Just Playing in It . After creating word clouds from Nintendo&#39;s descriptions of its highest selling titles from 2004-2010, there are some recurring themes that we see when Nintendo describes its games to players and potential customers. Words unique to the game, such as &quot;stage,&quot; &quot;kart&quot;, and &quot;world&quot; are combined with descriptors such as &quot;new,&quot; &quot;fun,&quot; and &quot;unique,&quot; as well as familiar terms such as &quot;Nintendo,&quot; &quot;Mario,&quot; and &quot;Bowser,&quot; to create a sense that the player will be buying into a refreshing, updated, and modernized version of a product that they know and love. I think that much of Nintendo&#39;s success in the gaming market comes from the so-called empire that it has created both with its consistency of creating modern versions of its classic titles and capitalizing off of the nostalgia for these titles as well. . For developers that are not Nintendo, I think that it is important to create characters that people will love, and create a universe around these characters, incorporating them into different games and genres. While Mario is one character that definitely become a poster-child for Nintendo, I think that other characters such as Link and Zelda, or the Pokemon franchise in general have also achieved a similar status of recognizability for the company, and would likely be top-performing games in a more modern dataset. . Conclusion . Through conducting this analysis of the video games dataset from CORGIS, I was able to learn a lot about the market in general, and what makes a &quot;successful&quot; game. My findings constrasted my expectations, but I was able to come to conclusions that I believe would be helpful for both game developers, and my own interests in gamifying learning. . In my exploration of both this project, and the course Digital Humanities 140, I learned many Python tools and became more comfortable working with new libraries as well as datasets. Although I used pandas for the majority of my analysis, the two libraries that I found helpful as well were seaborn and wordcloud for data visualization. Seaborn allowed me to combine aesthetic graphical information with statistical information, and wordcloud allowed me to create easy-to-understand visualizations, both of which reminded me of the importance of being able to tell a story with your data. . In the future, it would be fascinating to conduct a similar study with the modern video game market. Nowadays, gaming has been expanded to PC and mobile platforms, which were not represented in the CORGIS dataset. Additionally, many games are now free-to-play, so I think the metrics that are used for success may be a bit different that they were in my investigation. With the rise of e-sports and streaming, gaming is consumed in ways outside of simply playing the game, and has become a form of entertainment that is similar to movies, sporting, and YouTube. . I would like to acknowledge Professor Winjum for his dedication to instruction this quarter, and his continual understanding. Thank you! .",

            "content": "March 14, 2022 . Introduction . In the modern age, video games have become a modern past time enjoyed by many people of various ages. A now lucrative industry, video games come in a variety of genres, experiences, and platforms. When asked about successful video games, a handful of titles might come to mind. Ones that are iconic because of their characters, revolutionary because of the way they engage with storytelling, or perhaps nostalgic because of how long they have been around. . This project seeks to define top performing video games and the traits that may have contributed to the success of these titles. Subsequently, I would like to conduct a more qualitative investigation on these titles, mainly examining reviews to paint a clearer picture of what consumers like about top games. . The Data . Initial exploration of defining what makes a good game will be conducted using the Video Games CORGIS dataset which can be accessed here. This data was originally collected by Dr. Joe Cox who conducted an empirical investigation of U.S. sales data of video games. Dr. Cox concluded that the major factors that predict for a title&#39;s ability to attain &quot;blockbuster&quot; status were threefold: the company that produced the title, the console, and the critic reviews. . I would like to use the data that Dr. Cox collected, which spans thousands of titles that were released between 2004 and 2010, and conduct my own analysis agnostic to his fidnings. . The categoies that I am interested in and their possible effects on the success of a game are: . Maximum number of players: how many people can play this game at one time? | Online Features: does the game support online play? | Genre: what genre does this game belong to? | Within these categories, I would like to measure success of a game using: . Review score: the typical review score out of 100 | Sales: the total sales made on the game measured in millions of dollars | Completionist: players reported completing everything in the game | Data Exploration .

Because of the saturation of Action games, I would like to take a closer look at the metrics for success in that specific genre, as well as the other genres that are well-represented in the market. | Because the games that were successful in these categories were all sequels of some kind, I think it would be interested to investigate if there are any titles that were successful without being a sequel, which would speak to the degree to which a factor like nostalgia or investment in a story/ universe contribute to a title&#39;s success. | Because these three games did not have a max player capacity above 2, are there any titles that support multiplayer that are also finding success? | Are there certain publishers or consoles that are finding more general success with their titles than others? | Further Exploration . Based on the preliminary findings from my first data exploration, I would like to take a closer look at the data in certain places. . Defining Success . Using the metrics I established previously, I would like to examine the top-performing games in the categories of critic reviews, sales, and number of completionists. . 1. Critic Reviews . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;&gt; . Here, a sucessful game by critic review was defined as having a critic review score of over 90, of which there were 29 games. It does not seem to be the case, however, that a high critic score correlates very strongly to commercial success in sales. In fact, the games that received the highest critic scores were not the ones which had the most number of sales, with a handfull of games receiving more commercial sucess, and the highest seller (in this group) having the lowest critics score... . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;&gt; . I observed an even weaker relationship between critic review scores and number of completionists in for the games. . This could however be because the games which received the highest critic review scores, such as Grand Theft Auto IV, are known for being &quot;open-world&quot; games in which the player can freely navigate the world without the story being a main part of interacting with the game. . df2[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;, &#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, &#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;, &#39;Metadata.Genres&#39;]].sort_values(&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ascending = False) .

Notably, 27 out of the 29 titles that were considered top-performers as described by their critic review scores had Action as one of their genre descriptors. The two games that did not belong to this genre were considered as Role-Playing and Racing/ Driving games. . 2. Commercial Sales . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;&gt; . Very interestingly, for the top-performing games in terms if sales, being 14 games, there was actually a negative correlation between sales and critic scores. Shockingly, the game with the most sales had the lowest (sub-60) score of the group of games! However, the games with the highest critic scores in this set still had sales that were above the mean of the entire set, so these games were by no means unsuccessful. . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;Metrics.Sales&#39;, ylabel=&#39;Length.Completionists.Polled&#39;&gt; . A similar negative relationship was observed between sales and number of completionist players. For similar reasons as the to critic scores grouping, the top game, Wii Play, is not a game that is well-known for having a definitive plot that players follow, but rather is a game that is often played socially with family and friends. .

The distribution of genres in this group were slightly more diverse than that of the critic scores group. While Action games still held a slight majority at 8 out 14 games being part of the Action genre, Role-Playing, sports, and Driving games made up the remainder of this group. . 3. Completionists (or not?) . Following my analysis of the top-performing games under critic scores and commercial sales, I have decided not to continue with using number of completionists as a measure of success for a variety of reasons. Firstly, this number would already be skewed because of how the number of players would affect this figure, and completionist data as such would require standardization. While the additional work of standardizing this data is not very much work, I also chose not to use number of completionists in the remainder of my analysis because of how easily this number could be affected by the type of game. There are many games that are made simply to be enjoyed, and do not have the aspect of following a story or plot that other games have. In the former case, players would not be as motivated to &quot;complete&quot; the game, which would skew how the number of com . Action Games and Reviews? . Because of the overrepresentation of Action games in the games with high critic reviews, I wanted to explore the idea that critics tend to favor games that are of the Action genre. . df_action[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 0 85 4 61 13 74 17 74 18 72 .. 1197 42 1200 30 1204 58 1205 70 1211 39 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 476, dtype: int64&gt; . . df_sports[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 3 81 8 68 40 75 47 74 51 83 .. 1143 63 1163 63 1167 65 1170 80 1199 68 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 166, dtype: int64&gt; . . df_strategy[&#39;Metrics.Review Score&#39;].mean . &lt;bound method NDFrame._add_numeric_operations.&lt;locals&gt;.mean of 1 89 7 75 15 73 48 83 70 90 .. 1159 71 1177 78 1190 63 1198 74 1202 56 Name: Metrics.Review Score, Length: 62, dtype: int64&gt; . . Looking at the 3 most common genres and examining the mean critic review scores, it seems that there does not seem to be an inherent bias for Action games amonst critics, since strategy games had a higher mean score, though I think this is one area of analysis that could benefit from more investigation. . Who&#39;s at the Top? . From both my own personal perspective, as well as how I assume businesses and consumers would define success, I think commerical sales is the best way to mesure the success of a game. However, because I think critic reviews may encapsulate some measure of the quality of a game, I think it would be beneficial to include critics reviews as a measure of success in some way. Therefore, I decided that when choosing the &quot;top games,&quot; I would choose those games that were present in both categories or top-performers in critic scores and sales. That is, games that received both above a 90 on critic scores and had sales above 4.69. . To account for any phenomenon that goes beyond any conventional measure of success I would like to include those titles that had extremely high sales, but perhaps were not deemed a &quot;good game&quot; by critics. These three games would be: Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and New Super Mario Bros, all titles that had commericial sales greater that 10 million dollars. . top_sales .

Discussion . Examining the commonalities among the top performing games, it is clear that Nintendo games have the highest sales. They make up 6 of the 9 games that I identified as top-performing games, and represent the 6 highest-earning games in the entire dataset. This seems to operate independently of critic reviews, as the three highest selling games did not receive scores above 90 from critics. . I think that there are factors, especially metadata about each game beyond the scope of information that was included in this dataset, that contributes to why games from Nintendo, and especially those that came out at the top of this dataset were considered top-performers by sales. . Three of the top four games- Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and Mario Kart DS- are titles that do not have a strong storyline for the player to follow. Rather, they are multiplayer games that are centered around gaming as a social aspect. With family or friends, players can compete on teams with or against each other. Because you are constantly playing with real people in a competitive environment, the gaming experience is kept dynamic and engaging, rather then relying on a progressing in a story line. . When considering what kinds of games are successful in the market, it may be helpful to consider whether a game is player-versus-player (PVP) or player-vs-everyone (PVE). Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, and Mario Kart DS, are examples of PVP games, that is, players do not play by the themselves against computers, but rather against other real players, and these kinds of games inherently carry with them a competitive aspect. In terms of motivation, players are motivated to constantly return to the game in order to hone their skills in the game. In many PVE games, players are instead motivated by the desire to progress in the game itself. . The other game that was represented in the top-performing game, despite not having the same PVP quality as the others, was New Super Mario Bros. I think the reason that this title in particular was so successful is because of its recognisability. Just the name Mario in the gaming sphere is already enough for people, gamer or not, to have a mental image of what the game will entail. As a game that has had many remakes and interations, I think that this game&#39;s successful largely comes from its capacity to combine the nostalgia of players with the refreshing nature of a game remake or sequel. A game beloved by many, the Super Mario series of games is one that people are invested in because of their emotional attatchment to the games and characters. . When it comes to learning, motivation is a crucial part of pedagogy. In both the conventional sense and in the realm of possibly gamifying learning, I think that it would be helpful to incoroporate a healthy amount of competition, whether it be against the self or against others. I think it is also important for students to have the ability to engage with other students as well, as this social aspect to learning and gaming is something that motivates students additionally. . Nintendo: A Closer Look . Looking at the top-performing games, it is clear to see that Nintendo has a clear group on the gaming market when it comes to sales. As such, I would like to examine just what about these games makes them so desirable to players, and as such I would like to look to Nintendo themselves to see how they would market and describe these games. . It&#39;s Mario&#39;s World and We&#39;re Just Playing in It . After creating word clouds from Nintendo&#39;s descriptions of its highest selling titles from 2004-2010, there are some recurring themes that we see when Nintendo describes its games to players and potential customers. Words unique to the game, such as &quot;stage,&quot; &quot;kart&quot;, and &quot;world&quot; are combined with descriptors such as &quot;new,&quot; &quot;fun,&quot; and &quot;unique,&quot; as well as familiar terms such as &quot;Nintendo,&quot; &quot;Mario,&quot; and &quot;Bowser,&quot; to create a sense that the player will be buying into a refreshing, updated, and modernized version of a product that they know and love. I think that much of Nintendo&#39;s success in the gaming market comes from the so-called empire that it has created both with its consistency of creating modern versions of its classic titles and capitalizing off of the nostalgia for these titles as well. . For developers that are not Nintendo, I think that it is important to create characters that people will love, and create a universe around these characters, incorporating them into different games and genres. While Mario is one character that definitely become a poster-child for Nintendo, I think that other characters such as Link and Zelda, or the Pokemon franchise in general have also achieved a similar status of recognizability for the company, and would likely be top-performing games in a more modern dataset. . Conclusion . Through conducting this analysis of the video games dataset from CORGIS, I was able to learn a lot about the market in general, and what makes a &quot;successful&quot; game. My findings constrasted my expectations, but I was able to come to conclusions that I believe would be helpful for both game developers, and my own interests in gamifying learning. . In my exploration of both this project, and the course Digital Humanities 140, I learned many Python tools and became more comfortable working with new libraries as well as datasets. Although I used pandas for the majority of my analysis, the two libraries that I found helpful as well were seaborn and wordcloud for data visualization. Seaborn allowed me to combine aesthetic graphical information with statistical information, and wordcloud allowed me to create easy-to-understand visualizations, both of which reminded me of the importance of being able to tell a story with your data. . In the future, it would be fascinating to conduct a similar study with the modern video game market. Nowadays, gaming has been expanded to PC and mobile platforms, which were not represented in the CORGIS dataset. Additionally, many games are now free-to-play, so I think the metrics that are used for success may be a bit different that they were in my investigation. With the rise of e-sports and streaming, gaming is consumed in ways outside of simply playing the game, and has become a form of entertainment that is similar to movies, sporting, and YouTube. . I would like to acknowledge Professor Winjum for his dedication to instruction this quarter, and his continual understanding. Thank you! .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
